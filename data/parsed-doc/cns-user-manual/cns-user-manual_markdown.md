## CNS USER MANUAL

- 7.3 A description of the work approved under the CNS/NNIN program and proposed to be performed at CNS shall be provided by the User prior to the commencement of such work hereunder.  No substantive deviation from said statement of work will be permitted unless agreed to in writing by CNS.

## 8.0 Requirements for Use of Federally-Funded Laboratory

## 8.1 Background

- 8.1.1 CNS operates as a regional laboratory facility partially funded through the NSF NNIN program.  This funding subsidizes the operation of the laboratory and reduces User fees.  In light of this support, all Users of the facility must agree to acknowledge the NSF as a sponsor in publications, and must agree to respond to annual requests for lists of publications and similar output.

## 8.2 NSF Acknowledgement Requirement

- 8.2.1 CNS facility Users are required to acknowledge the Center for Nanoscale Systems and the NSF's National Nanotechnology Infrastructure Network (NNIN) in any publications or presentations that result from work performed in whole or in part in the CNS/NNIN facilities, or with assistance from CNS staff.

## 8.3 Annual Reporting

- 8.3.1 All publications, presentations, journal covers and patents resulting from the use of CNS facilities or through assistance from CNS staff must be reported to the CNS administrative office.  Listing of publications etc. shall be entered via the CNS User Portal webpage.
- 8.3.2 Submission of an annual report for active projects is required by NSF as a provision of the NNIN program.  All Users must provide if requested a summary of work accomplished during the year.
- 8.3.2.1 This report is submitted to the NSF for use in presentations, typically in slideshow format.
- 8.3.2.2 The report should not contain confidential information, as it may be used in presentations to illustrate the range of research topics at CNS.  The User's host institution also acknowledges that its identity may be made public in presentations and other materials describing CNS and the NNIN.

## 9.0 Training and Certification

## 10.0 Modes of Instrument Use

- 10.1 Direct Use is conducted by certified users who operate instruments without staff support.
- 10.2 Assisted Use is instrument use where a CNS staff member operates the instrument, and the User attends and observes, or vice versa in the case of training certification.  User is billed for the full costs of the instrument time and the staff time used.  User does not require instrument certification.

SOP148\_CNS Operational Policy\_r1.0.docx

Page 7 of 12

Effective Date: 09-SEPT-13

<!-- image -->

## CNS USER MANUAL

- 14.4.1 Time increments for equipment are hours, half-hours, or quarter-hours depending on the instrument or facility.
- 14.4.2 Time used is rounded up to the nearest increment.

- 14.4.3.1 If a facility malfunctions due to reasons beyond the User's control (not a crash or error caused by the user), the User must complete and submit a CNS User Fee Waiver Form.
- 14.4.3.2 Other examples include a building evacuation, severe inclement weather preventing access to the facilities, or a tool reservation being rendered unusable due to a malfunction in another tool.
- 14.4.3.3 NOTE:  Entries in comments fields in either the CLEAN Systems logs or Scheduling Tool entries are not considered valid requests to waive or alter billing for a session.  These fields are used solely by the technical staff to better see an instrument's performance over time, and are not read by the Admin staff.  No billing adjustments will be made based solely upon entries in the CLEAN System or Scheduling Tool.

## 14.5 Room Entry Billing

- 14.5.1 Time increments for laboratories are days or hours.
- 14.5.2 Facilities that charge a per day fee use an actual calendar day as basis of charge. A day is 12:00 am to 11:59 p.m.
- 14.5.2.1 If a User enters a per-day-fee facility from 6 - 10 am and then returns from 9 - 11 pm, they are charged for 1 day.

## CNS USER MANUAL

- 14.6.2 If a User does not log in for the time they reserved on a CNS facility or tool on the CNS Scheduling Tool, they will be charged for the unused reservation. This charge is not subject to the monthly cap.
- 14.6.2.1 Unused reservations deprive other Users of opportunities to use the equipment and are contrary to the NSF-led mission of the Center to optimize use of shared equipment for scientific research.
- 14.6.2.2 As such, if the uncapped fees incurred are not sufficient to prevent recurring 'No Show' reservations by a user, additional penalties may be levied at the sole discretion of CNS.
- 14.6.2.3 Penalties may include suspension of access to the facility in question, a requirement to prove perusal and comprehension of all CNS User Policy documentation, or full account suspension depending on the severity and number of offenses.

## 14.7 Fee Waivers

- 14.7.1 Requests to void a charge for a missed reservation may be submitted via the 'Fee Waiver' form.

## CNS USER MANUAL

- 15.2 Once a reservation is made for a training event, the User is responsible to pay the training fee whether the training is attended or whether the user subsequently passes the certification.
- 15.2.1 Training reservations may be canceled up to 24 hours in advance.
- 15.3 For all trainings which occur in a facility that charges an access fee, the access fee still applies (for example, the LISE Cleanroom).

CNS will invoice for the total amount billed without regard to the total dollar value of a purchase order or not to exceed amount associated with it.  The host institution is bound to pay the total amount per the signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed at the time of enrollment.
- 16.5.1 Internal Harvard University users, while not using a purchase order to secure use of CNS services, are still bound by the provisions of 16.5 and are not permitted by set fixed cost spending ceilings for users, PI's, or projects.
- 16.6 Due to the trial-and-error nature of scientific research, CNS is not bound to either provide or honor any quotes regarding pricing for a particular project or activity. The per unit cost of instrumentation is available via the posted rate sheets, but the time is variable and unknowable.

## 17.0 Security of Property

- 17.1 Users are responsible for their personal property, which may include devices, cell cultures, masks, wafers, notebooks, chemicals, glassware, and other supplies and,
