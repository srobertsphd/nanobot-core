## C-14

A C-14 is a Certificate of Fitness for Non-Production Laboratories issued by FDNY.  FDNY requires that permitted labs in New York City must be under the supervision of a C-14 holder.  This means there must be at least one person on the ground floor of the ASRC if there is anyone working in the lab.  During regular operating hours, facility staff are on-site and fulfill this requirement, but during after-hours, there is no guarantee that there are other C-14 holders on-site, so all members who wish to enter the cleanroom during after-hours must have a C-14.

There are different options for obtaining a C-14 for the ASRC address depending the level of degrees or certifications held by the member: (1) Members with a masters or doctoral degree or members with a bachelor's degree and 2 years of post-baccalaureate experience in the operation of chemical laboratories may apply for alternative issuance, thus may apply online; (2) Those not eligible for the alternative issuance program will need to take the test at FDNY; (3) If you already have a C-14 issued for an address other than the ASRC, then you will only need to submit a copy of your current C-14 with a dual request letter from the ASRC.

## APPLY BY MAIL:

If a member already has a C-14 for an address other than the ASRC, they do not need to apply for a new certificate.  They will need to submit a dual request letter with a copy of their current C-14 in order to receive an additional card specific to the ASRC address.  Contact Tom Dickson (tdickson@gc.cuny.edu) in order to request the dual request form letter and provide a copy of the current C-14.  Once the form letter is filled and then signed by ASRC's designated coordinator, they will mail the request into FDNY for processing.

Once you have received your new C-14 card, you must bring it to the ASRC to be logged. Contact Tom Dickson (tdickson@gc.cuny.edu) in order to do this.

All C-14s have expiration dates, and any renewals must be submitted within 90 days past the expiration date.  If your C-14 is over 90 days expired it will no longer be considered valid and you will lose after-hours access.

FDNY is sometimes inconsistent with issuing certificates, so if a member has successfully applied for a C-14 but FDNY has failed to issue the certificate in a timely manner, they may request after-hours from staff.

Keep in mind that a C-14 is not the only requirement for members to receive after-hours. Simply receiving a C-14 does not automatically impart after-hours access.
