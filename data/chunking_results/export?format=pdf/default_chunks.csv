3,"Be aware that hazardous flammable and oxidizing gasses are used in the RIE tool. The gasses are safely contained, and the lab is equipped with a Toxic Gas Monitoring System (TGMS)- but always be alert and aware of any unusual tool behavior. Contact staff immediately with concerns. Evacuate the building immediately if the TGMS Blue Light Alarm sounds and encourage others to do so too. If the TGMS Yellow Light Alarm sounds, evacuate the cleanroom. If you ever smell anything unusual during venting, immediately close the tool and contact staff.

9,"All materials in the chamber must be first approved by the tool manager. As this tool does not have a load lock, it is generally advised that no toxic materials (eg- Arsenic, Indium Tin Oxide, MoSe2, WSe2, or any other material whose MSDS contains the symbols below) be etched in significant quantities. If permitted by the tool manager, any time a toxic material is etched, it must be followed by a purge step (5 minutes, 100 SCCM Argon) before the main chamber can be vented and opened. As a precaution, all recipes on this tool are followed by a built-in purge step that must always be run. There is also a stand alone 'PURGE' recipe that can be run if the step is accidentally skipped.

2. Ensure in 'Lab User' mode. Never operate in any other mode.
3. Under the 'Manual' Menu tab (See Photo), check that the vacuum is sufficiently pumped down ('High Vac' gauge at 5x10 -5 Torr or less) and the tool is in 'Idle' mode.
4. Ensure the previous user ran cleaning process by navigating to the 'Activity Explorer' Section of the 'Data' tab. Be sure to click 'Module' and 'Recipe' to sort by recipe and 'Refresh' for the most recent activity ( See Photo.)

Note - the 'High Vac' gauge shows the pressure of the chamber when no process gas is running. If the 'High Vac' gauge is displaying a number, values in the 'Process Gauge' reading can be ignored. If a process gas is running or if the chamber is otherwise at high pressure, the 'High Vac Gauge' will turn off and the 'Process Gauge' value can be read.
Note - If a gauge is stuck at 7.5x10-9 Torr and never fluctuates, this is not a real reading. The gauge is stuck and can be unstuck by running a venting or purging process. Tell tool manager if this happens.",569,RIESOPv2DRAFT.pdf,7,Standard Operating Procedure:,Standard Operating Procedure:,default
12,"(Conditioning is optional but can help consistency of results)
1. Insert the black graphite process plate (and if you like, your carrier/conditioning wafer as well) by first venting the chamber. (Click the 'Vent' Button on the Manual Page. You will hear a hissing noise)
Note - if the tool has been under vacuum a long time, you may hear a loud 'thud' when venting begins. This is normal.
Note - The material of a plate can affect a process and some processes may be run on other material plates if permitted
Note - If the plate seems dirty, you may want to clean it with the nitrogen gun near the tool. Remember to wear eye protection if you do this.
2. Wait for the entire Vent process countdown to complete. When the countdown is complete, it will return to an 'Idle' state and a purple '1' indicator will appear (See Photo). This typically takes about five minutes
3. Turn the Open/ Close knob on the tool to 'Open' and hold down both green 'Start' buttons simultaneously to open chamber. (See Photo)
4. Remove the white quartz cleaning plate, and insert the black graphite process plate. Be sure to align the screw in the surface of the tool chamber to the hole in the rear of the process plate. If you are using a carrier or conditioning wafer, place it in the groove at the center of the plate. The plasma will be strongest near the center of this circular groove.
5. Turn the Open/Close knob on the tool to 'Close' and hold down both green 'Start' buttons simultaneously to close the chamber. The chamber is fully closed when it stops moving, and when the monitor displays an image of a closed chamber and only '1' purple indicator (not '2').
6. Click 'Pump' in the Manual page to commence chamber pump down. This typically takes about 3-4 minutes.
7. Go to the 'Recipes' tab in the lower menu to open the Recipe Editor page. Select your desired recipe from the recipe list on the left.",1894,RIESOPv2DRAFT.pdf,8,II. Conditioning Step/ Season Chamber,II. Conditioning Step/ Season Chamber,default
13,"8. Click on the 'Step Time' number of the RF step, and it will change into a field that allows you to enter your desired conditioning/etch time. You must hit 'Enter' to save the value and click outside the region to revert to the setpoint view. The 'Stabilize' slider should always be 'off' for this step.
9. Click the 'Save' Button Floppy Disk at the top of the screen. (If you do not save, your recipe changes will not register.)
Users should not create their own new recipes. Users should not change anything but the Step Time of the RF/ etching steps of a recipe unless explicitly permitted to do so. Under no circumstances should users change the gasses used, Alarm levels, Maximum Reflected Powers, Tolerance Times, or Capacitor Positions. If you need further recipe customization, please contact the tool manager.
NoteAny saved recipe changes will be permanent between sessions, so if you are allowed to change something beyond time please return it to the original setting when you are done
NoteThe maximum reflected power is typically 5% of the forward power, not higher than 10% of the forward power, and not higher than 15W. Alarm level is typically ~5% of forward power and not higher than 5W. RF Power tolerance time is usually not higher than 10 seconds and should never be 0.  If you observe an unusual value please contact tool manager.
Note - Processes in recipes are always sandwiched between 'pump to base pressure' steps. The recipes must always end with APC open, RF off, gasses off, and temperature at 20C.
Note - Do not rely on a recipe to be identical to one you ran during another session just because the name is the same. Record all recipe setpoints when you run it and ensure they match desired values.
10. Return to the 'Manual' display.
11. Ensure the pressure in the chamber has dropped to 'Vacuum OK' status.
12. Ensure that the chamber pressure has actually dropped to base pressure or lower (The base pressure for a process is 5x10 -5 torr (0.05 mtorr).
13. Click on the Upper-Right (not Lower Left!) 'Recipes' Tab to open the 'Process Recipe' Sidebar Menu.
14. Select your saved recipe from the drop-down recipe menu and click 'Start'
15. Observe the process in the Manual Display. Ensure that actual process parameters match with setpoints, and that the 'Reflected Power' value is always very low. You must stay in the cleanroom for the entire process. Stop the process and contact staff if you notice any unusual behavior.
16. Accept Pop-up message in lower-right corner when process is finished.
If you need to prematurely stop a process step with hazardous gasses or materials, it is preferable to click 'Skip Phase' rather than stop . This ensures any additional purge steps of the recipe are completed.
Note - The 'Pause' button will stop RF power but will not stop the flow of process gasses
Note - Even after your plasma is off, you may still see small (<1) or negative numbers in the forward or reflected power fields. This is normal and there is no active RF power/plasma present.
Note - Venting the chamber is the only time you should see any purple 'Process readiness' alerts on the screen. If you see them at any other time (or anything else in the schematic that appears purple but usually isn't) it usually indicates a tool issue. Contact staff if you observe this.

17,"Note - If attaching a chip to a carrier wafer, use only the smallest possible amount of Fomblin oil to adhere it to the center of the wafer and ensure even cooling. Apply evenly via the non-swab end of a swab so that the Fomblin oil is not visible after the chip is applied and ensure the chip doesn't move when gently nudged by tweezers. (Chips poorly applied can be disturbed by the vacuum). Visible Fomblin oil may affect your process. Fomblin oil (or any liquid) should never drip to the underside of the carrier wafer . Running a first etch on a dummy chip may be beneficial.
1. Once conditioning process is complete, follow the steps above for venting the chamber, inserting your sample, and running a recipe. Make sure any mandatory purges for hazardous gasses or toxic materials are performed before opening the chamber. Retain the black graphite process plate in the chamber, and change the RF step time to your desired etch time. The etch recipe will vary from your conditioning etch only by the time of the etch step.
