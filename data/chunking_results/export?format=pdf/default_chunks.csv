0,"To  clean  silicon  wafers  in  preparation  for  high-temperature  processing.  RCA  clean  is  a procedure for removing metal ions from silicon wafers. In the process it oxidizes the silicon and leaves a thin film of oxide on the surface of the wafer. If wafer proceeds to undergo thermal oxide processing, an HF or BOE clean should be added after the RCA-2 clean and before the spin rinse dryer to remove the native oxide layer.",431,RCACleanSOP.pdf,1,Principle of Operation,Principle of Operation,default
1,"Equipment:  substrate,  three  Pyrex  bath  containers,  two  thermometers,  one  polypropylene containers (for HF dip), PFA wafer carrier with handles, and fluorocarbon (CTFE) tweezers
-Note: A full set of dishes have been set aside for use with RCA cleaning. Do not use these dishes for any other purpose. Clean these dishes thoroughly before storing them.
Chemicals:  Hydrofluoric  Acid  (HF  48-51%),  Hydrochloric  Acid  (HCl),  Ammonium  Hydroxide (NH4OH 30%), Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2 30 %)
-Chemical Hazards
o HF: Liquid or vapors are serious health hazards, cause severe burns and bone loss,  which  may not be immediately painful or visible. Significant exposure (100 mL)  can  kill  directly.  Use  extreme  caution,  HF  is  very  hazardous,  both  acutely and long term.
o HCl: Liquid or vapors are serious health hazards and cause severe burns.
o NH4OH:  Liquid  is  extremely  basic  and  corrosive.  Exposure  can  cause  severe burns.
o H2O2: Liquid or vapors are serious health hazards, and can cause severe burns. Peroxide is an explosive hazard and thus requires vented waste containers.
