Danger: Piranha waste involves oxygen gas which can pressurize and break sealed containers. Do not store mixed Piranha in a sealed container.  It is very important that you reset and start the  Piranha  waste  timer  on  the  fume  hood  whenever  you  dump  Piranha  waste  in  the  acid carboy  so  the  cleanroom  staff  can  determine  whether  or  not  the  Piranha  waste  is  safe  for disposal.",444,Piranha Clean SOP.pdf,1,Principle of Operation,Principle of Operation,default

-Warning:  Pirahna  attacks  organics,  including  most plastics.   It  will  react  violently  with polyethylene and polypropylene tweezers and containers.  It will also react violently with organic solvents such as acetone and isopropanol.",389,Piranha Clean SOP.pdf,"1, 2",Equipment:,Equipment:,default

4,"1. Rinse all beakers with DI water prior to beginning the process.
2. Stand the beaker to be used for rinsing on a few fab wipes in the hood and fill it with DI water so that the water level will cover the entire substrate.
3. Get a glass beaker that will fit your samples for processing - you should find one labeled 'Piranha' on the shelves. Place it on fab wipes in the hood.
4. Put your samples in the empty container and determine how much solution you will need to cover them.
5. Determine  the  ratio  of  sulfuric  acid  and  hydrogen  peroxide  you  will  be  using  for  the Piranha clean and the required volumes of each to completely submerge your sample. Typical Piranha ratio is 3 parts Sulfuric Acid and 1 part Hydrogen Peroxide.
6. Measure out the necessary volume of Sulfuric Acid and pour into the Piranha beaker.
7. Measure  out  the  necessary  volume  of Hydrogen Peroxide and carefully pour into the Piranha beaker. The solution will heat up and start to bubble.
8. Load  sample/wafer  boat  and  thermometer  into  Piranha  beaker.  Thermometer  should read  >80°C  for  optimal  cleaning  temperature.  If  <80°C,  place  Piranha beaker on hot plate.
9. Allow your samples to sit in the Piranha clean for 10-20 minutes to remove all organics.",1266,Piranha Clean SOP.pdf,2,Piranha Clean,Piranha Clean,default
5,"1. When the Piranha clean is complete, carefully transfer the sample/wafer boat into the DI water beaker.
2. If you used tweezer to move the sample, make sure you leave them in the rinse beaker as well.
3. Let the samples and tools soak in DI water for 5 minutes.
4. Remove the samples and rinse them with the DI water gun over the hood sink.

7,"1. Allow the hot Piranha to cool to room temperature before disposing of the solution. If you are going to leave the mixture unattended, make sure it is properly labeled before doing so.
2. Dump the Piranha solution into the carboy designated for acids.
3. Rinse the container once with DI water, and dump it into the same carboy.
4. Rinse the beakers used to measure the chemicals with DI water, and dump them into the acid carboy.
5. Dump the rinse water beaker into the acid carboy.
6. Rinse all containers again with DI water over the hood sink.
7. Return all cleaned/dried labware to its proper location. The beakers can drip dry on fab wipes in the hood; however, remember to move them back to their storage location once dry.
8. Wipe up any drips in the area with chemical wipes and dispose of them in the proper trash.
9. Store  the  Sulfuric  Acid  in  the  acids  cabinet  and  store  the  Hydrogen  Peroxide  in  the oxidizers cabinet.
10. Inspect all  of  the  PPE  to  ensure it did not come into contact with the chemicals before returning them to its storage location.",1083,Piranha Clean SOP.pdf,3,Cleanup,Cleanup,default

-Eye: Immediately flush with water for at least 15 minutes while lifting upper and lower eyelids occasionally. Get immediate medical attention.
-Ingestion: Do not induce vomiting. Get immediate medical attention.
-Inhalation: Remove to fresh air. Resuscitate if necessary. Take care not to inhale any fumes released from the victim's lungs. Get immediate medical attention.",502,Piranha Clean SOP.pdf,3,Contact,Contact,default
