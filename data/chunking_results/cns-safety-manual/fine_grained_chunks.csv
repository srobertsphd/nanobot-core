223,"Biological effects can result from exposure to RF energy.  Biological effects that result from heating of tissue by RF energy are often referred to as ""thermal"" effects.  It has been known for many years that exposure to extremely high levels of RF radiation can be harmful due to the ability of RF energy to heat biological tissue rapidly.  This is the principle by which microwave ovens cook food.  Exposure to extremely high RF intensities can result in heating of biological tissue and an increase in body temperature.  Tissue damage in humans could occur during exposure to high RF levels because of the body's inability to cope with or dissipate the excessive heat that could be generated.  Two areas of the body, the eyes, and the testes, are particularly vulnerable to RF heating because of the relative lack of available blood flow to dissipate the excess heat load.",875,cns-safety-manual.pdf,45,Radio-Frequency Exposure:,Radio-Frequency Exposure:,fine_grained

263,"Before chemicals can be brought into any CNS facility, they must first be approved by certain CNS staff and the LISE building Lab Safety Advisor. Approval is granted through a system called Material Request Form. Material Request Forms can be found on the CNS website under the User Section. Under forms look for Material Request Forms.",336,cns-safety-manual.pdf,50,Chemical Transportation.,Chemical Transportation.,fine_grained

265,"§ Ensure you have been approved to bring a specific chemical into the clean room via material request forms.
§ Material Request forms can be found on the CNS user portal under forms.
§ Ensure that you have informed your CNS contact the volume of the chemical you wish to store in the clean room. Flammable liquid volumes are controlled closely by EHS. There is a set limit of flammable liquids allowed in the clean room. There is also a space allocation issue for all other chemicals but especially flammable liquids.
§ Ensure chemicals are delivered to your own facility first.
§ Then bring the chemical in its original Department of Transportation (DOT) approved packaging to CNS. No more than 4 gallons at any one time.
§ Then bring the chemical in its original Department of Transportation (DOT) approved packaging to CNS. No more than 4 gallons at any one time (approval is needed via Material Request form).
§ Bring the original package into the gowning station and place it on the floor next to you.
§ Ensure that there are enough rubber chemical carriers in the gowning station to handle transport into the clean room.
§ If rubber carriers are not available enter clean room to find some (chemical is still in original shipping package in gowning station).
§ Upon returning to the gowning station open the package and place chemical bottle directly into the rubber carrier and bring to a designated chemical cabinet (if not sure contact a CNS staff member).
§ If you want to transport chemicals from another local (Cambridge Campus) Harvard building to CNS, ensure that the chemical is in a leak proof primary container and then place in a secondary sealed container. The chemical name, date and your contact information must be on the secondary container.
§ If you are transporting a lab-made experimental material, the container(s) should be labeled with:
§ Researcher's name
§ Material identification (name of the chemical compound(s) in the sample container, and the quantity and/or concentration of each
§ Appropriate hazard warnings (e.g., GHS hazard classification, biohazard symbol).  If hazards for multiple containers are similar, a single label on the secondary container is sufficient.
§ If applicable, specify that the sample is dry nanomaterials or nanomaterials in solution, as nanomaterials may exhibit unusual reactivity and toxicity from their parent compounds",2386,cns-safety-manual.pdf,"50, 51",Transporting chemicals within CNS facility,Transporting chemicals within CNS facility,fine_grained
