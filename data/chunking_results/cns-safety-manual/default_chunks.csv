40,"o Carcinogen : Carcinogens are materials that are known or suspected of causing cancer after repeated exposure over an extended period of time. Examples include Inorganic arsenic,
chloroform, formaldehyde, hexavalent chromium, asbestos, diesel exhaust and tobacco smoke. Trichloroethylene is a suspect carcinogen.
o Combustible : A material that is capable of burning and will ignite only if heated. The temperature necessary before a fire could be started is called the flash point. Examples include Photoresists and N-Methyl-2-Pyrollidone (NMP).
o Corrosive : Corrosives cause permanent damage or burns to the eyes, skin, or mucous membranes such as the inside of the nose or mouth. Examples include hydrofluoric acid, ammonium hydroxide, developers (CD-30, MIF 400), acetic acid, buffered oxide etch (BOE), phosphoric acid, nitric acid, and gold etchant. Hexamethyl disilazane (HMDS) is both a flammable and a corrosive liquid.
o Irritants : Irritants cause a reversible inflammation of the eyes, skin, or mucous membranes such as the inside of the nose or mouth. Examples include photoresists, isopropyl alcohol, acetone, and many more.
o Flammable : A flammable material is capable of burning and will readily ignite at room temperature. Examples include acetone, isopropyl alcohol, hexamethyldisilane (HMDS), hydrogen gas, n-butyl acetate.
o Oxidizer : Oxidizers are materials that readily yield oxygen or other oxidizing gas, or that readily react to promote or initiate combustion of combustible materials. Examples include hydrogen peroxide, chlorine gas, oxygen, nitrous oxide gas, and nitric acid.
o Pyrophoric : Pyrophoric are materials that will spontaneously ignite in air at or below a temperature of 130 F. They do not need an ignition source like a flammable or a combustible material. Examples of pyrophoric: silane gas and diborane gas.
o Reproductive Toxin : Reproductive toxins are materials that can affect the ability to reproduce or can cause birth defects in offspring. Examples include n-Methylpyrrolidone (NMP is found in Remover PG, PRS 3000 Resist Stripper, and Microposit Remover 1165 ), lead, and carbon monoxide.
o Sensitizer : Sensitizers can cause an allergic reaction in a sensitive individual. Typically, this reaction would be after repeated exposure. Examples: nickel and gold may cause sensitization upon contact with skin.
o Target Organ Effects : Target organ effects are a general term which applies to a wide variety of potential health affects where a material can affect a certain part of the body. Target organ effects can potentially cover any body system including the lungs, liver, kidney, blood, or central nervous system. Examples include: All hazardous chemicals have an effect on some systems of the body.
o Toxic : Toxic materials are potentially poisonous at low levels of exposure. Highly toxic materials are potentially poisonous at extremely low levels of exposure. Examples include chlorine gas, diborane gas, phosphine gas, hydrofluoric acid.
o Unstable : Unstable materials are capable of dangerous reaction, even explosion, caused by excessive heat or pressure.
o Water Reactive : Water reactive materials are capable of a dangerous reaction when exposed to or mixed with water. Examples include: hexamethyldisilane (HMDS).",3285,cns-safety-manual.pdf,"26, 27, 28",Physical and Health Hazards of Chemicals,Physical and Health Hazards of Chemicals,default

Typically, a chemical will be noticed long before it is present at a concentration that is potentially harmful. These chemicals are said to have good warning properties since a person can readily detect the chemical before it is present at a hazardous level.
Some chemicals can be present at levels that are potentially harmful but lack properties that warn of their presence. These chemicals are said to have poor warning properties since a person could be exposed to potentially harmful levels without any warning. In these cases, continuous chemical detection systems are used that alert a person to the presence of the chemical at potentially hazardous levels.",797,cns-safety-manual.pdf,28,Chemical Warning Properties,Chemical Warning Properties,default
42,"∞ Acids : Acids are corrosive to skin and eyes causing serious burns. Generally, the effect is very quick with the exception of hydrofluoric acid which has a delayed effect. Most acids give off corrosive vapors. Examples of acids are acetic, hydrochloric, hydrofluoric, nitric, phosphoric, 10:1 buffered oxide etch (BOE).
∞ Bases : Bases (also called alkali or caustic) are corrosive to skin and eyes causing serious burns. Bases are especially hazardous to the eyes causing permanent damage. The effect is relatively slow starting as a slippery feeling on the skin. Examples of bases are ammonium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, and tetra methyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) found in certain photoresist developers (CD 30, MIF developers).
∞ Oxidizers : A material that can start or increase a fire by donating oxygen. They can also cause severe skin or eye irritation or even burns. Examples of oxidizers: hydrogen peroxide, oxygen gas, nitric acid.
∞ Solvents : Solvents are liquids used to dissolve other materials. They are typically irritating to skin and eyes and give off strong vapors. Inhalation can cause headaches or dizziness. Most solvents are flammable or combustible liquids. Examples of solvents are acetone, isopropyl alcohol, hexamethyldisilane (HMDS), n-butyl acetate, n-Methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and photoresists.",1326,cns-safety-manual.pdf,29,Chemical Hazard Classes,Chemical Hazard Classes,default
43,"Compressed gases are all hazardous due to their storage pressure. Most can cause suffocation in the event of a large release in a confined area. Compressed gases can be 'inert' presenting very little, if any, health hazard or they can have a variety of hazards including flammable, corrosive, pyrophoric, oxidizing, or toxic. Examples of compressed gases are ammonia, argon, boron trichloride, silane, forming gas (hydrogen-nitrogen mixture), freons, hydrogen, nitrogen, and silicon tetrafluoride.
The gases used within the facility for processing are generally supplied under high pressure from steel compressed gas cylinders. In most cases, these cylinders are housed in special gas cabinets and fitted with a variety of high purity valves, regulators and flow control devices. Gas cylinders must be treated with respect in all cases. An enormous amount of energy is stored in the compressed gas.

48,"Refer to Material Safety Data Sheets for specific Hazards for each chemical. However, since Hydrofluoric Acid and others can be so toxic and used extensively that we will expound on the hazards.
Hydrofluoric Acid, 48% : Corrosive to eyes, skin, and mucous membranes. Vapors are severely irritating or corrosive. Toxic if swallowed. Corrosive effects can be delayed for several hours. Prolonged contact may cause bone damage. If contacted, rinse with water for five minutes and massage Calgonate gel onto affected area. Seek medical attention.
Hydrofluoric acid (HF) looks like water and can be mistaken as harmless. If you suspect that the liquid is HF treat it as HF.
Concentrated HF is considered ""extremely"" toxic (4, on the health hazard scale of 0-4). However, any solution containing a source of free fluorine ions is also hazardous.  A concentrated ammonium fluoride solution is considered ""very"" toxic (3, on the health hazard scale), yet becomes ""extremely"" toxic when made more acidic, such as in the BOE (buffered oxide etch) mixtures we use at CNS.  So, even though 20:1 BOE has much less HF (about 7% of volume) than 49% HF, because it also has about 38% NH4F and it is acidic, it presents the same toxic hazards as 49% HF.
On contact, HF easily passes through skin and tissue.  Because its action can be delayed for many hours, it can be distributed throughout the body.
Negatively charged fluorine ions bind very easily to positively charged calcium and magnesium ions to form insoluble salts (CaF2 and MgF2 salts form some natural gemstones.)  In the body, Ca and Mg ions are used to mediate a variety of physiological processes, such as muscle movement and heart function. Calcium is also a chief component in bone.
Local tissue damage (at the area of contact) results from free hydrogen ions which cause corrosive chemical burns, and free fluorine ions which cause deep tissue damage including erosion of bone.
Systemic damage can occur when fluorine becomes distributed throughout the body.  These conditions include POTENTIALLY FATAL electrolyte imbalances such as hypocalcemia (too little calcium) and hyperkalemia (too much potassium).  Since calcium and potassium regulate the heartbeat, irregular beating and cardiac arrest are manifestations.
o Deaths have been reported from concentrated acid burns to as little as 2.5% BSA [body surface area exposed to HF]. For reference, this is equivalent to the area of the FRONT AND BACK OF ONE HAND.
Calcium gluconate is used as an antidote. This provides extra calcium ions which can scavenge free fluorine ions before they penetrate and damage tissue. In cases of skin contact, calcium gluconate gel must be applied immediately to the area of contact.
Pure hydrogen fluoride is an extremely toxic gas which very easily dissolves in water. ""Hydrofluoric acid"" describes this solution form. HF easily passes between gas and liquid phases; so, HF- (and NH4F-) containing solutions will emit toxic fumes.  Although CNS lab safety precautions tend to emphasize protection against skin contact with fluoride-containing solutions, remember to avoid inhalation of the fumes by always working under fully exhausted areas of the wet benches.  And DON'T put your HEAD inside the bench.
Do not use glass containers to store HF in. Use only plastic containers. HF etches glass.
N-Methylpyrrolidone (NMP) : Combustible liquid. Can be readily absorbed through the skin. Can cause severe eye irritation. Repeated or prolonged contact can cause skin irritation. Strong solvent odor. Use two pairs of nitrile gloves when handling. NMP is listed as a reproductive toxin under Proposition 65. NMP has been identified by the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm. Remover PG 1165 and Baker PRS 3000 and AZ 400T Photoresist Developer contain this chemical.
∞ Silane Gas can ignite spontaneously upon contact with air. It can accumulate in certain areas and then explode. The gas is very unpredictable, and it is stored and distributed to the cleanroom from the LISE loading dock gas storage room M14.
∞ Piranha Etch: Is a common name applied to a mixture of Hydrogen Peroxide and Sulfuric (typically 1:5). Piranha is extremely aggressive toward organic materials such as flesh and photoresist residue. It also removes heavy metal contamination. It is difficult to dispose of this mixture as the waste continues to react and decompose for an extended period of time. This continuing reaction can build up pressure in closed containers, eventually causing them to burst. Also, if the solution is mixed very peroxide rich, unstable compounds may be formed. Therefore, Piranha is not allowed to be stored in closed containers. Nanostrip is a commercial stabilized version of Piranha Etch and is a recommended substitute.

67,"Biological effects can result from exposure to RF energy.  Biological effects that result from heating of tissue by RF energy are often referred to as ""thermal"" effects.  It has been known for many years that exposure to extremely high levels of RF radiation can be harmful due to the ability of RF energy to heat biological tissue rapidly.  This is the principle by which microwave ovens cook food.  Exposure to extremely high RF intensities can result in heating of biological tissue and an increase in body temperature.  Tissue damage in humans could occur during exposure to high RF levels because of the body's inability to cope with or dissipate the excessive heat that could be generated.  Two areas of the body, the eyes, and the testes, are particularly vulnerable to RF heating because of the relative lack of available blood flow to dissipate the excess heat load.
At low levels of exposure to RF radiation, i.e ., levels lower than those that would produce significant heating; the evidence for production of harmful biological effects is ambiguous and unproven.  Such effects, if they exist, have been referred to as ""non-thermal"" effects.  Several reports have appeared in the scientific literature describing the observation of a range of biological effects resulting from exposure to low-levels of RF energy.  However, in most cases, further experimental research has been unable to reproduce these effects.  Furthermore, since much of the research is not done on whole bodies ( in vivo ), there has been no determination that such effects constitute a human health hazard. -from http://www.fcc.gov/oet/rfsafety/rf-faqs.html#Q5

68,"Electromagnetic radiation in the 1 mm (about 0.04 in) to 1 m wavelength range (300 MHz to 300 GHz) is referred to as
microwave radiation and is part of what is known as radiofrequency (RF) radiation. The latter covers the 0.5 MHz to 300 GHz range and is considered in the context of adverse biological effects. RF radiation is nonionizing radiation. This means that, in general, it does not have sufficient energy to kick an electron off an atom thus producing charged particles in a body and causing biological damage. The only proven harmful effect from exposure to microwave (or RF) radiation is thermal. RF radiation can enter deep into the body and heat human organs. Thus, the depth of penetration and the level absorption of radiation in the body are relevant.
Heating at above 10 GHz (3 cm wavelength or less) occurs in the outer skin surface. - From 3 GHz to 10 GHz (10 cm (about 3.94 in) to 3 cm) the penetration is deeper and the heating higher.
From 150 MHz to about 1 GHz (200 cm (about twice the length of a baseball bat) to 25 cm (about 9.84 in) wavelength), penetration is even deeper and because of high absorption, deep body heating can occur.
Any part of the body that cannot dissipate heat efficiently or is heat sensitive may be damaged by microwave radiation of sufficient power. The lens of the eye and testes are respective examples. Are there non-thermal ADVERSE effects of microwave radiation in humans? We know that there ARE non-thermal effects: microwaves can cause hearing sensation, can affect behavior (in animal studies), etc.
Are these effects adverse and reversible? Research is continuing in this area as well as in RF radiation effects on immune and central nervous system. Much more work is needed, and you can get a degree in science and do some research in this area. Have said all this, it is my personal view that manufactured effects (i.e., those that have not been a part of our natural history) must be treated with caution, and lack of evidence for adverse effects is NOT the same thing as proof of safety.

70,"Ultraviolet light is a radiant energy which occupies the region between visible light and X-ray in the electromagnetic spectrum. The hazards of the emitted radiation depend upon the wavelength. The UV section of the spectrum is divided into three parts:
UV-A (315-400 nm): radiation equivalent to that received from the sun, and unless a person is especially sensitive, the most that can happen to his/her skin is that it will tan.
UV-B (280-315 nm): is the middle range of UV radiation, and it is more harmful.
UV-C (180-280 nm): overlaps X-rays and must be dealt with under extreme precautions.",596,cns-safety-manual.pdf,47,Spectra of Ultraviolet Light,Spectra of Ultraviolet Light,default
71,"Ultraviolet burns of the eye (actinic keratosis) are very painful, but not normally of lasting effect (UV-A and UV-B). Often an individual does not initially realize that they have been exposed. Hours after
exposure, an exposed person may notice that their eyes become painful, feeling as if grains of sand are under the eyelid. Often the victim does not make the connection between working with UV-emitting light source and the pain being experienced.
Some studies connect UV exposure to skin cancer; severe burns are also possible.",533,cns-safety-manual.pdf,"47, 48",Symptoms of Overexposure,Symptoms of Overexposure,default

If you are working with UV-C or high doses of UV-A or B, you should also protect your skin. Special creams are available for this.
If you are working with a UV emitting source, be certain that other people in your area are guarded from direct radiation. The use of plastic shields and prominently placed signs are helpful. Never look directly at the source. Also, be careful to avoid reflections from metal surfaces.",568,cns-safety-manual.pdf,48,UV Safety Guidelines:,UV Safety Guidelines:,default

82,"Chemicals must be brought directly into the clean room and not left unattended for any amount of time.
§ Ensure you have been approved to bring a specific chemical into the clean room via material request forms.
§ Material Request forms can be found on the CNS user portal under forms.
§ Ensure that you have informed your CNS contact the volume of the chemical you wish to store in the clean room. Flammable liquid volumes are controlled closely by EHS. There is a set limit of flammable liquids allowed in the clean room. There is also a space allocation issue for all other chemicals but especially flammable liquids.
§ Ensure chemicals are delivered to your own facility first.
§ Then bring the chemical in its original Department of Transportation (DOT) approved packaging to CNS. No more than 4 gallons at any one time.
§ Then bring the chemical in its original Department of Transportation (DOT) approved packaging to CNS. No more than 4 gallons at any one time (approval is needed via Material Request form).
§ Bring the original package into the gowning station and place it on the floor next to you.
§ Ensure that there are enough rubber chemical carriers in the gowning station to handle transport into the clean room.
§ If rubber carriers are not available enter clean room to find some (chemical is still in original shipping package in gowning station).
§ Upon returning to the gowning station open the package and place chemical bottle directly into the rubber carrier and bring to a designated chemical cabinet (if not sure contact a CNS staff member).
§ If you want to transport chemicals from another local (Cambridge Campus) Harvard building to CNS, ensure that the chemical is in a leak proof primary container and then place in a secondary sealed container. The chemical name, date and your contact information must be on the secondary container.
§ If you are transporting a lab-made experimental material, the container(s) should be labeled with:
§ Researcher's name
§ Material identification (name of the chemical compound(s) in the sample container, and the quantity and/or concentration of each
§ Appropriate hazard warnings (e.g., GHS hazard classification, biohazard symbol).  If hazards for multiple containers are similar, a single label on the secondary container is sufficient.
§ If applicable, specify that the sample is dry nanomaterials or nanomaterials in solution, as nanomaterials may exhibit unusual reactivity and toxicity from their parent compounds
