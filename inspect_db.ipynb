These fees are expressed as dollar-per-hour for most instruments and dollar-per-day charges are also applied for access to certain laboratories.\\n14.2.1 User fee schedules are available on the CNS website.\\n14.3 User or Institution has 10 days from date of invoice in order to make contact with the CNS Administration Group at the email address: info@cns.fas.harvard.edu, to officially dispute the accuracy of an invoice or specific charge.  After 10 days from the date of invoice, the charge is considered accepted and acknowledged and will not be altered.\\n14.4 Instrument Time Billing\n",
