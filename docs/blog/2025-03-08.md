# Starting with MkDocs - Love at first sight!

## Introduction

I am sitting here in the St Agnus NYPL Library, where I spent a lot of the past week, writing code, and avoiding stinky homeless people.  I am also master of sneaking in food, as there is no food or drink here, though they do allow water.  

This has been an incredible journey.  IT was only last weekend, 6 days ago, that I took the time to try and understand how to use CUrsor, the VS Code IDE AI developer tool.  I have written a huges amount, abour 1500 lines of working code, developping the pipeline for Nanobot.  

Anyhow, I digress.  Now I need to start documentation, and I asked CLaude 3.7 to make some suggestions.  I chose to start with MkDocs, and it is rather nice!  Here I will talk about how to use it, in a very general way:

## What it Does

You can find it at [MkDocs Pages](https://www.mkdocs.org/), and the Github repo is at [Github MkDocs](https://github.com/mkdocs)

This is my current dir structure.  I place the `/docs` directory in the root of my nanobot project.  

```bash
docs/
├── api/
│   ├── database.md
│   └── services.md
├── blog/
│   ├── post-2025-03-08.md
│   └── index.md
├── user-guide/
│   ├── document-processing.md
│   ├── index.md
│   └── vector-search.md
├── examples.md
├── getting-started.md
└── index.md
```

## How to install it

```bash
# Core MkDocs package
pip install mkdocs

# Material theme for MkDocs
pip install mkdocs-material

# MkDocstrings for API documentation from docstrings
pip install mkdocstrings[python]
```

you will also need a file with the configuration `mkdocs.yml`.
My current YAML file looks like:

```YAML
site_name: NanoBot Documentation
site_description: Documentation for the NanoBot POC project
site_author: Your Name

# Standard docs directory
docs_dir: docs

```

## How to use it

I havent worked with this but more than 1 hour now, but here is what I know:

You can serve the pages locally by running the following command from the root
```bash 
mkdocs serve
```
This will launch a local server on port 8000 `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` where you interact with the HTML version of it.  It is evidently a Bootstrap implementation.  

You can add documents to this
