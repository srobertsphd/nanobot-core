# Starting with MkDocs - Love at first sight!

## Hello World! 🌐

I am sitting here in the St Agnus NYPL Library, where I spent a lot of the past week, writing code, and avoiding stinky homeless people.  I am also master of sneaking in food, as there is no food or drink here, though they do allow water.  

This has been an incredible journey.  IT was only last weekend, 6 days ago, that I took the time to try and understand how to use CUrsor, the VS Code IDE AI developer tool.  I have written a huges amount, abour 1500 lines of working code, developping the pipeline for Nanobot.  

Anyhow, I digress.  Now I need to start documentation, and I asked CLaude 3.7 to make some suggestions.  I chose to start with MkDocs, and it is rather nice!  Here I will talk about how to use it, in a very general way:

## What it Does

You can find it at [MkDocs Pages](https://www.mkdocs.org/), and the Github repo is at [Github MkDocs](https://github.com/mkdocs)



## How to install it

```bash
# Core MkDocs package
pip install mkdocs

# Material theme for MkDocs
pip install mkdocs-material

# MkDocstrings for API documentation from docstrings
pip install mkdocstrings[python]
```
### YML File Structure
You will also need a YML file with the configuration `mkdocs.yml`.
My current YAML file looks like:

```YAML
site_name: NanoBot Documentation
site_description: Documentation for the NanoBot POC project
site_author: Your Name

# Standard docs directory
docs_dir: docs

theme:
  name: material
  palette:
    primary: indigo
    accent: indigo
  features:
    - navigation.tabs
    - navigation.sections
    - toc.integrate
    - search.suggest
    - search.highlight

markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.highlight
  - pymdownx.superfences
  - pymdownx.tabbed
  - pymdownx.tasklist
  - admonition
  - toc:
      permalink: true

plugins:
  - search
  - mkdocstrings:
      handlers:
        python:
          selection:
            docstring_style: google
          rendering:
            show_source: true
            show_root_heading: true

nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - Getting Started: getting-started.md
  - User Guide:
    - Overview: user-guide/index.md
    - Document Processing: user-guide/document-processing.md
    - Vector Search: user-guide/vector-search.md
  - API Reference:
    - Database: api/database.md
    - Services: api/services.md
  - Examples: examples.md
  - Blog: 
    - Overview: blog/index.md
    - 2025-03-08: blog/2025-03-08.md
```
### docs File structure (Holds all of your Markdown files)
This is my current dir structure.  I place the `/docs` directory in the root of my nanobot-poc project.  
> NOTE: The `index.md` files are necessary

```bash
docs/
├── api/
│   ├── database.md
│   └── services.md
├── blog/
│   ├── post-2025-03-08.md
│   └── index.md
├── user-guide/
│   ├── document-processing.md
│   ├── index.md
│   └── vector-search.md
├── examples.md
├── getting-started.md
└── index.md
```
## How to use it

I havent worked with this but more than 1 hour now, but here is what I know:

You can serve the pages locally by running the following command from the root
```bash 
mkdocs serve
```
This will launch a local server on port 8000 `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` where you interact with the HTML version of it.  It is evidently a Bootstrap implementation.  

> NOTE: If you change the YML file you will need to stop the server `ctl C` and then restart it again by `mkdocs serve`

You can add documents to this but to get them seem in the navigation sidebar you need to add them to the YML file.  If you know the file name you can still navigate to it using the URL but you will not see it in the `nav` sidebar.  

You can deploy this to github.  In the case of my own repo of `nanobot-poc` I would navigate to `srobertsphd.github.io/nanobot-poc` and this is where it would reside.  There is an order of events though. 

### Updating GitHub repo

1. Update your Markdown Docs
2. Update you `mkdocs.yml` file to unclude any new docs
3. Navigate to your project directory
4. Push the updated mkdown to the repo
```bash
git add docs/ mkdocs.yml
git commit -m "updated documentation"
git push
```
5. Deploy to GitHub Pages using MkDocs  

```bash
  mkdocs gh-deploy
```
> ### Important Notes
> * If your repository is private, you'll need a GitHub Pro, Team, or Enterprise account to use GitHub Pages  
> * It may take a few minutes for your site to be available after deployment  
> * You can check the status of your GitHub Pages deployment in your repository settings


## Closing Comments

Writing code is so much fun.  Learning new libraries in minutes is amazing fun.  Leaning how to document things and start writing in less than an hour and having it look good and be accessible --> INCREDIBLE good feeling.   

No drugs needed.  

Hello World.  Thank you.
